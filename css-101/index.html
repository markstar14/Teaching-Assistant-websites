			Hello, my name is Mark and I am a student at the University at Buffalo
			<br><br>
			I am studying Computer Science and History, and I am aiming to graduate in May of 2016 with A Masters of Computer Science, a Bachelors of Computer Science, and a Bachelors of History
			<br><br>
			I am currently a teaching assistant for CSE 101 and CSE 341, but in Fall of 2015 I was a teaching assistant for CSE 101, CSE 111.
			<br><br>
			In my spare time I volunteer as a firefighter in my home town, where I have been a member for close to seven years.
			<br><br>
			I enjoy watching and playing Soccer, and I am a casual fan of Hockey as well. However, I very much dislike Football, Baseball, and Basketball.
			<br><br>
			Follow the links above to view my resume and course history, or visit the search page to do a Google search about any of the topics I have mentioned.
			<br><br>
			Thanks for visiting my website, I hope you have a wonderful day!
