				<h4><a name="norway">Norway Continues Westward expansion!</a></h4>
				<p>As the ocean's continue to gradually drain, the once modest European nation of Norway is beginning to advance west. This is thanks to the new land bridge 
				that has been recently uncovered, which directly connects Newfoundland with the region of Norway formerly known as Britain. Canada is preparing to retaliate against the forces of this leading world power, 
				but given the massively successful history of conquest belonging to Norway, the idea of an independent Canada in the future is looking bleak. Historians in Tokyo, East Norway have declared last week that if it 
				was not for the mysterious underwater portal off the coast of East Norway, which as everyone knows is continuously draining the oceans and providing new land ways between formerly isolated nations, then 
				the originally innocuous European nation of Norway would have remained just that, a small nation in northern Europe. However, thanks to the lower sea levels, Norway has become landlocked, and 
				were forced to begin expansion in what has become to more successful campaign in known history. How long will it take before Australia, the Americas, and even Antarctica are overcome by the might
				of Norway? This reporter is willing to bet that nothing will be able to stop Norway, so it is only a matter of time before the nations of West and South Norway are readily established. </p>

				<h4><a name="spider">Spider Streams are getting Bigger!</a></h4>
				<p>Most people know that the average number of spiders crawling on a person at any given second is a manageable 10 to fifteen, but that number may be increasing soon due to the evident expansion of 
				the spider streams of the world. These mysterious landmarks used to be where natural fresh water was located, but were somehow replaced overnight by an equivalent volume of spiders. This was 
				somewhat concerning to the general populous at the time, but the human race has adapted to this change, and now we gladly accept our new arachnid overlords. They have also virtually wiped out the 
				mosquito population, so it isn't like the spiders were a complete nuisance. However, it would appear that the streams of spiders are beginning to rapidly expand, scientists think this is due to the 
				population boom that is coming, as this marks the end of the intubation period for many species of spiders. So a word of warning, you may be used to accidentally eating three to four spiders a minute now, but 
				that number will be increasing by quite a bit, very soon.</p>

				<h4><a name="question">Top Ten Leading Causes of Injury </a></h4>
				<p>1.  Lightning Strikes -- Apparently, Zeus is not happy with the vast majority of people on this planet</p>
				<p>2.  Unknown -- You tell us why people just end up hurt sometimes. We have no idea. Maybe a wizard did it.</p>
				<p>3.  Predation -- We used to think that humans were at the top of the food chain, but ever since Jurassic Park, that's not really true any more....</p>
				<p>4.  Betrayal -- Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!</p>
				<p>5.  Curses(ancient + modern) -- This time, we know a wizard did it! Maybe #2 is Cthulhu or Will Wheaton or something.</p>
				<p>6.  Ant Bites -- One ant we can manage, but two? Three? Or, god forbid, four ants?! No human is that resilient.</p>
				<p>7.  Falling -- You would think that we would just stop going to high places, we know that gravity hates humans, but people just don't learn.</p>
				<p>8.  Spider Bites -- There may only be one species of spider, but they are still the size of a small suv, so one bite tends to be somewhat lethal.</p>
				<p>9.  Bite(other) -- One thing is for sure, wild animals are super not fond of the human race.</p>
				<p>10. Natural Causes -- Most are quite painless, which is nice, unless you have the cold....and if you do, good luck, you will need it.</p>

				<h4><a name="roc">Tips and Tricks to Surviving a World of Rocs </a></h4>
				We all know of the Rocs, the gigantic demon birds unleashed upon us by Adolf Hitler in 1947, two years after he was smuggled out of his bunker in Berlin. Ol'Adolf may be long gone, but 
				his fun loving, air plane sized raptors decided to stick around. This has produced some problems for humans in the last few decades, the main one being the Roc's tendency to swoop down
				and catch a human every so often to feed itself. We humans have adapted to this by staying inside vehicles when outside. This has helped until recently because, while a roc is self-evidently capable of lifting and carrying adult 
				humans without difficulty, even the largest among them would struggle to lift a typical 1,200 kg sedan. While it's plausible that a flock could accomplish this by cooperative lifting, they 
				have instead taken to dropping boulders (usually 50-100 kg) on the cars from above. This is why most commuters stick to the tunnels, despite the obvious threat posed by Stalin's Basilisks. So,
				despite the title, there isn't actually any tips or tricks to surviving in this world that we live in. Were you really expecting any? We live in a world populated with enormous demon birds of prey
				and slightly less enormous demon snakes that kill by locking eyes with its target. Let's just be realistic and accept our fate.

				<h4><a name="ocean">PSA: The annual ocean disappearance is approaching </a></h4>
				It is that time of the year again, and by that I mean that it is time for the oceans, and indeed all large bodies of water, to spontaneously and instantly disappear for the span of fourteen hours.
				Scientists are still not aware of why this happens, but it is certainly a terrifying occurrence, that cost several thousand lives the first few years that it happened. Most people still remember the first time
				where one moment children were swimming in lakes, married couples were enjoying a vacation on a cruise ship, and the seas were filled with all sorts of fascinating and bizarre creatures. Then, in the next moment
				all of the water just isn't there any more, and all occupants start to fall to the newly revealed ground. The water doesn't come back until exactly fourteen hours later every year, but the exact day is never
				clear. All we know is that it happens sometime in August. The affects of this mysterious event have been truly horrible, beyond the massive loss of human lives, all forms of life that live in the oceans have become
				extinct, along with many species whom relied on sea life as a source of food. Some animals, such as penguins and seals are being preserved, but most species of fish are all but gone. The exception being the 
				Leviathen and Kraken, which immediately transitioned to life on the surface in the most terrifying way possible. Humanity lost millions of dollars in infrastructure when ships crashed to the sea floor, and all 
				nations basically lost their Navy strength. We don't want such a disaster to happen again, but we are almost sure that it will occur again, and it will be some time this month, so be wary when making plans to go out onto the water.

				<h4><a name="second">The Debut of the One Second Day! </a></h4>
				The earth's rotational velocity is accelerating at a truly impressive rate. At least, impressive by a scientific standpoint, as a normal person, it is terrifying, and you should any god(s) you may believe in
				that it starts to slow down. Given the current rate of velocity, scientists estimate that within the year the earth will be able to complete one full rotation, i.e. one day, in the time it takes for a person to blink.
				We won't be able to experience that though, because all life on earth will be wiped out within a couple months if this trend continues. Research shows that if the earth begins to spin fast enough, the atoms will
				compress and earth will resemble a disk-like world, somewhat reminiscent of the disk world from Terry Pratchet's wonderful book series. When asked why the earth will do this, the scientist put his hands in the 
				air, wiggled his fingers and said "Physics" in what could be described as a spooky voice. This reporter believed that he was patronizing me. So, I punched the jerk right in his smug sense of superior-self-satisfaction, i.e. his face.
				Anyway, eventually, and by that I mean very soon, this disk world will be uninhabitable for human life, and all life will die long before the really cool stuff starts to happen. Basically, the earth will be ripped apart
				and become a planet sized buzz saw, which will look sick! If it manages to hit the moon before it completely falls apart, then that would be even cooler, theoretically, the buzz saw of god would instantly obliterate the moon, causing
				an explosion that will be brighter then the sun, vaporize the surface layers of Mars and Venus, and knock what is left of the moon out of the solar system. I'd assume it would then strike some alien world and wipe out 
				the alien dinosaurs on that planet. So, enjoy life while you can, and hold solace in the fact that when we go down, we are going to take a race of alien dinosaurs with us! What other species can say that?
