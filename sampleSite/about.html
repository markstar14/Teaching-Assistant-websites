			<p> I am currently in my Senior year at the University at Buffalo, and I expect to graduate in May 2016. Beyond being a double major in History and Computer Science, I am also a part of the combined M.S./B.S. program. This means that upon my graduation, I will be receiving a Bachelor of Arts in History, a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and a Master of Science in Computer Science. My unofficial transcript is linked below in order to examine my academic history. </br></br> Outside of classes, I have been a volunteer fire-fighter in my home town for over five years. I am also currently working with a group of other students on the design of an application for M&T Bank, which they will utilize at career fairs as a sign-in app for students.   </br></br> My interests lie largely in software design and engineering, so my post graduation plans are to find a career in that field. Preferably somewhere on the upper west coast, since I have always wanted to live in or near Seattle. </p>
